It&apos;s the strangest thing. You came to stay at your grandfather&apos;s house for a month during summer vacation, and two weeks ago while you were out watering the lawn your grandfather disappeared from inside the house and you haven&apos;t seen him since. The house is not large, and there is no back door. He&apos;s a fairly fit individual for his age, but there is no real reason to suspect that he went out through a window. You filed a missing persons report with the local police department but they have not managed to come up with anything yet either. While wandering through the house, you managed to find a trap door under the stairs, and upon entering you find yourself in...

An Interactive Fiction by Erik Ylvisaker

Under the stairs
You are in the secret room beneath the stairs in your grandfather&apos;s house. Shelves line the walls here, with a lot of junk on them. Your grandfather was an avid collector of antiques, but you can tell from the vast array of broken clocks and watches, scratched dishes, tarnished silverware and other junk before you that he doesn&apos;t have quite the eye for valuable antiques. There is so much junk that it would take a thorough search to find anything useful. One item does catch your eye, however, the full-length, oval-shaped mirror with a beautiful stand in the corner.

You can type HELP anytime to get help.

Basement
You appear to be in some sort of Basement, lit solely by a lantern on a shelf. Shelves line the east and north walls, but they are mostly empty. A beautiful mirror stands against the south wall. A ladder pokes through the ceiling in the corner of the room.

On the shelves are journal page 2 and a brass lantern.

Inside the Shack
You are inside a dilapidated shack. There is a rather shabby door on the south side, which is closed. This appears to be someone&apos;s actual living quarters, as the furnishings are rather complete. It&apos;s only one room but there is a kitchen space for cooking as well as a creaky bed. A desk is in the corner, covered in stacks of paper. A ladder pokes through a hole in the floor.

On the kitchen counter is a piece of beef jerky.

West Field
You are in the west end of a large, grassy field, surrounded by tall trees. Nestled against the trees at the north end, you see a dilapidated shack. A narrow path goes southwest into the trees. 

You can see a small brown dog here.

You are inside a dilapidated shack. There is a rather shabby door on the south side, which is open. This appears to be someone&apos;s actual living quarters, as the furnishings are rather complete. It&apos;s only one room but there is a kitchen space for cooking as well as a creaky bed. Above the kitchen counter is a cupboard, which is closed. A desk is in the corner, covered in stacks of paper. A ladder pokes through a hole in the floor.

On the creaky bed is a small brown dog.

On the kitchen counter is a piece of beef jerky.

June 2nd I have managed to train Atari in a few things. I have to say her name each time I want to give her a command. Saying something like &quot;Atari, get on the bed&quot; seems to work well. She only seems to be obedient when I am holding some food however.

You hear barking coming from beyond the shabby door.

This page has been ripped and heavily chewed on. Only a few words are legible:

You are inside a dilapidated shack. There is a rather shabby door on the south side, which is open. This appears to be someone&apos;s actual living quarters, as the furnishings are rather complete. It&apos;s only one room but there is a kitchen space for cooking as well as a creaky bed. A desk is in the corner, covered in stacks of paper. A ladder pokes through a hole in the floor.

On the floor is the mess of papers you knocked off the desk.

On the kitchen counter is a piece of beef jerky.

You can also see Atari and journal page 3 here.

Pit Room (north side)
You are in a room with a deep gaping pit. The pit is rectangular in shape, running east-west and cuts the room in two. The air here is significantly cooler than in the rest of the mausoleum. To the south across the pit is the other half of the room, and to the north is the passage back to the crypt.

    <result xml:space="preserve">It turns out the pit isn&apos;t bottomless, but it *is* a very long way to the bottom. But for some reason, you manage to land unharmed.

Bottom of the Pit
You are at the bottom of a deep pit, shaped like a long rectangle. The walls around you are steep and smooth; there is no chance of climbing back up. There are various bones strewn about here.

An old withered piece of parchment paper lies on the floor here.

The text reads: 

The crown and scepter are far too powerful to fall into the wrong hands. As I have no son, I fear that those who follow in my footsteps may not share my vision for this country. As such, I have had a fake crown crafted for my successor and decided that the true crown is to be buried with me. The scepter has already been given to my trusted friend and advisor Captain Neckbeard, so that he may hide it in a far away land. I will write here, as the only copy, the means to operate the scepter, in hopes that one day a true ruler of the land may emerge and use it to lead the people into the prosperity they deserve. 

The operation of the scepter is simple. One need only point it at one&apos;s enemy and utter the words &quot;klaatu barada nikto&quot; and the enemy will be incinerated. Take care however, that the crown is worn at the same time, otherwise disastrous consequences may follow. 

It is with great regret that I write this. I was not able to achieve the prosperity of my kingdom that I had hoped for. I am thankful that I shall not live to see it undone by those bickering fools who vie for my throne. 

His Majesty, 
Dalton
