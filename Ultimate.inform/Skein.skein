It&apos;s the strangest thing. You came to stay at your grandfather&apos;s house for a month during summer vacation, and two weeks ago while you were out watering the lawn your grandfather disappeared from inside the house and you haven&apos;t seen him since. The house is not large, and there is no back door. He&apos;s a fairly fit individual for his age, but there is no real reason to suspect that he went out through a window. You filed a missing persons report with the local police department but they have not managed to come up with anything yet either. While wandering through the house, you managed to find a trap door under the stairs, and upon entering you find yourself in...

Under the stairs
You are in the secret room beneath the stairs in your grandfather&apos;s house. Shelves line the walls here, with a lot of junk on them. Your grandfather was an avid collector of antiques, but you can tell from the vast array of broken clocks and watches, scratched dishes, tarnished silverware and other junk before you that he doesn&apos;t have quite the eye for valuable antiques. There is so much junk that it would take a thorough search to find anything useful. One item does catch your eye, however, the full-length, oval-shaped mirror with a beautiful stand in the corner.

You can type HELP anytime to get help.

Basement
You appear to be in some sort of Basement, lit solely by a lantern on a shelf. Shelves line the east and north walls, but they are mostly empty. A beautiful mirror stands against the south wall. A ladder pokes through the ceiling in the corner of the room.

On the shelves are journal page 2 and a brass lantern.

Inside the Shack
You are inside a dilapidated shack. There is a rather shabby door on the south side, which is closed. This appears to be someone&apos;s actual living quarters, as the furnishings are rather complete. It&apos;s only one room but there is a kitchen space for cooking as well as a creaky bed. A desk is in the corner, covered in stacks of paper. A ladder pokes through a hole in the floor.

On the kitchen counter is a piece of beef jerky.

West Field
You are in the west end of a large, grassy field, surrounded by tall trees. Nestled against the trees at the north end, you see a dilapidated shack. A narrow path goes southwest into the trees. 

You can see a small brown dog here.

You are inside a dilapidated shack. There is a rather shabby door on the south side, which is open. This appears to be someone&apos;s actual living quarters, as the furnishings are rather complete. It&apos;s only one room but there is a kitchen space for cooking as well as a creaky bed. Above the kitchen counter is a cupboard, which is closed. A desk is in the corner, covered in stacks of paper. A ladder pokes through a hole in the floor.

On the creaky bed is a small brown dog.

On the kitchen counter is a piece of beef jerky.

June 2nd I have managed to train Atari in a few things. I have to say her name each time I want to give her a command. Saying something like &quot;Atari, get on the bed&quot; seems to work well. She only seems to be obedient when I am holding some food however.

You hear barking coming from beyond the shabby door.

You are inside a dilapidated shack. There is a rather shabby door on the south side, which is open. This appears to be someone&apos;s actual living quarters, as the furnishings are rather complete. It&apos;s only one room but there is a kitchen space for cooking as well as a creaky bed. A desk is in the corner, covered in stacks of paper. A ladder pokes through a hole in the floor.

On the floor is the mess of papers you knocked off the desk.

On the kitchen counter is a piece of beef jerky.

You can also see Atari and journal page 3 here.

You can see a small brown dog here.
