    <result xml:space="preserve">It's the strangest thing. You came to stay at your grandfather's house for a month during summer vacation, and two weeks ago while you were out watering the lawn your grandfather disappeared from inside the house and you haven't seen him since. The house is not large, and there is no back door. He's a fairly fit individual for his age, but there is no real reason to suspect that he went out through a window. You filed a missing persons report with the local police department but they have not managed to come up with anything yet either. While wandering through the house, you managed to find a trap door under the stairs, and upon entering you find yourself in...&#x000A;&#x000A;The Ultimate Text Adventure&#x000A;An Interactive Fiction by Erik Ylvisaker&#x000A;Release 1 / Serial number 180621 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD&#x000A;&#x000A;Under the stairs&#x000A;You are in the secret room beneath the stairs in your grandfather's house. Shelves line the walls here, with a lot of junk on them. Your grandfather was an avid collector of antiques, but you can tell from the vast array of broken clocks and watches, scratched dishes, tarnished silverware and other junk before you that he doesn't have quite the eye for valuable antiques. There is so much junk that it would take a thorough search to find anything useful. One item does catch your eye, however, the full-length, oval-shaped mirror with a beautiful stand in the corner.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can type HELP anytime to get help.&#x000A;&gt;</result>

This appears to be someone's actual living quarters, as the furnishings are rather complete. It's only one room but there is a kitchen space for cooking as well as a creaky bed. A desk is in the corner, covered in stacks of paper. A ladder pokes through a hole in the floor.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the kitchen counter is a piece of beef jerky.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

"I'm sure he's alive and well. The king has his faults, but he is not quick to execute interlopers." The wizard pauses, and stares at you thoughtfully. "You know," he begins, "I might be able to help you to rescue your grandfather. The king was once a student of mine, and in spite of our differences, I still have some sway with him," the wizard pauses, puffing on his pipe. "There are two important national artifacts that have been missing for several years. If you could bring them to me I will speak to the king on your behalf. I'm sure that he would be willing to grant a favor to the person who finds and returns them."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

"I am looking for a crown and a scepter. They both belonged to a previous king from a few generations back, a fair and just man by the name of Dalton. His crown and scepter both disappeared when he died. Bring me those items, and I will see that your grandfather is returned to you." The wizard stares at you.

It's made of solid gold, and encrusted with all manner of rare and valuable jewels, but it is light-weight and slim for a real elegant look. I saw it up close once, you know, when I was but a lad who had barely seen eight summers. Some say it had some sort of magical power. Rumor has it, the crown was buried with the king when he died." The wizard puffs on his pipe again and lets out a sigh. "Unfortunately, in these dark times thievery runs rampant. The mausoleum where he is buried has been thoroughly ransack by brigands, and this wonderful national treasure has long been lost."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The former king always carried it with him, but it was rarely prominently displayed. There was some rumor that after his death it fell into the possession of a friend of his, who captained a ship. One day, that ship set sail and never returned. Some say the ship was sunk in a great battle by pirates, others say the ship ran aground on a reef somewhere and the crew ended up starving." &#x000A;&#x000A;Another long drag on the pipe, and then the wizard shrugs, "Perhaps they simply found treasure somewhere and have retired to some island paradise. No one even knows if the scepter was on the ship when it disappeared." The wizard stares off into the distance, as if remembering some long-forgotten painful event. "Even with my skill with magical scrying, I have been unable to locate the scepter."&#x000A;&#x000A;The wizard looks at you pointedly, leaning forward in his chair. "So what do you say? Will you look for the crown and scepter?"&#x000A;&#x000A;(You could say yes or no; or ask him about the jeweled crown or the scepter.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

"I have a gift for you. I suspect you will need to return to your own home to gather things which may help you find the crown and scepter. Somewhere near the waterfall there is a key for a lost traveler to return home, but that such a key can only be found during a terrible storm. I will give you this wand of weather-changing. It's very easy to use, all you need to do is wave the wand and it will effect a change in the weather. I'd suggest digging in the sand around the banks near the waterfall for that key." &#x000A;&#x000A;The wizard holds out his hand offering you the wand, which you take carefully. &#x000A;&#x000A;"Be sure and bring the crown and scepter back to me," the wizard continues, "and be careful who you show them to.

    <command xml:space="preserve">help</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">You can issue commands to the game by starting with a verb. For instance, typing EXAMINE THE DOOHICKEY will cause the game to report the results of such an examination. (You needn't type in uppercase, but I will use uppercase to distinguish the commands you may type in.) You may wish to try this now by typing EXAMINE SHELVES. &#x000A;&#x000A;Other useful commands are SEARCH (something), TAKE (an object), DROP (something you are carrying). Typing LOOK by itself will give you a description of the area you are currently in. A good strategy is to type LOOK to get the area description, and then use EXAMINE on the nouns that you see in the description. Many verbs have synonyms, for example you can type LOOK AT (something) instead of EXAMINE (something). Also, some commonly used verbs can be abbreviated, for examine EXAMINE SHELVES can be abbreviated with X SHELVES. &#x000A;&#x000A;You are not currently in a room with exits, but when you are you can move about with a command like GO SOUTH, SOUTH, or just S. Other directions can be abbreviated as well with a command like NW for northwest, etc.&#x000A;&#x000A;Finally, you can type INVENTORY or just I to get a list of items that you are carrying. Also, if you want to repeat the last command, you can type AGAIN or just G. &#x000A;&#x000A;To get help on a specific topic, type HELP (topic). The following help topics are supported: &#x000A;    HELP introduction &#x000A;    HELP objects &#x000A;    HELP conversation &#x000A;    HELP saving &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

This appears to be someone's actual living quarters, as the furnishings are rather complete. It's only one room but there is a kitchen space for cooking as well as a creaky bed. A desk is in the corner, covered in stacks of paper. A ladder pokes through a hole in the floor.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the kitchen counter is a piece of beef jerky.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
